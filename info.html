					<h4>Game Modes</h4><br>
					<p>
						Classic: In Classic mode, the goal is to win the race (come in 1st, 2nd or 3rd depending on the race's goals).<br><br>

						<span class="inf">Time Attack:</span> The race has a time limit. To win the race, the player has to cross the finish line before the timer runs out. More time is added to the timer when a checkpoint is reached or by collecting green clock pickups on the track.<br>

						<span class="inf">Hunted:</span>
 						The race has a time limit. To win the race, the player has to escape in time or will be busted. Police vehicles are more durable than regular cars but can be taken down with a shockwave-knockdown, an aerial takedown, a landing knockdown or a 360. At the end of the race, the player has to successfully perform a stunt to finish the race. Failure to do so has the player's car crashing into a police barricade and losing the race.br><br>

						<span class="inf">Slipstream:</span>
 						In Slipstream mode, the car behind can fill up the nitro tank by following the slipstream trail of the car ahead, allowing them to catch up easily.<br>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="appear text3">
					<h4>Car Tuning</h4><br>
					<p>"Tuning" a car is required to get a car to higher stats. In 			addition to the performance rating, each car has a star rating 		hat increases the maximum performance rating and is unlocked by 	collecting model-specific blueprints.<br><br>

						All cars in the game can be upgraded with blueprints called "Import parts." Every car has a base price for upgrading with these parts, and regardless of how many were already used, these do not increase in price. The 3 different import parts are as follows:<br><br>

						<span class="blue">Uncommon Blueprints</span><br>
						<span class="purple">Rare Blueprints</span><br>
						<span class="yellow">Epic Blueprints</span><br><br>
						<span class="blue">Uncommon</span> import parts are parts that are shared with every car in the game. These parts can be used to upgrade any car without a class restriction.<br><br>

						<span class="purple">Rare</span> import parts are parts that are class-specific. There are still 4 different parts but now vary between each class. Some parts are only used for Class C, while others are only used for Class B.<br><br>

					<h3>Henrico Lewin</h3><br>
					<p>
						Absolutely loving this game! The blueprint grind is a bit much, so waiting on the new seasons to max out most of my cars. Other than that, great time killer. *2022 update* With the different game modes on offer, it becomes easier to obtain and upgrade cars without having to spend actualmoney. Some might complain that it's pay to win but the game is meant to be fun first, competitive after. Overall, STILL a great game. worth 5 stars!
